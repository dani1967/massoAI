Licenza GNU General Public License v3.0
                GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                   Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use this
General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any
other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your
programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change software or use pieces of it in new free
programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of software, or if you
modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms
that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can
get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) Avert, when an interactive program is released, that it conveys to
users notice that it is covered by this License, and provides an
opportunity to see the full text of this License. (2) Accompany the
program with this License. For works that are programs, this of course
entails providing "the source code". The source code is the preferred
form of the work for making modifications to it.

  A work covered by this License is licensed under this License as a
whole. This applies to programs and other practical works. If you
distribute copies of such a work, you must do so under this License.
Even if it is a part of a larger work, this License applies to the
entire whole, provided it is copyrightable.

  This License is not a mere license; it is an obligation to make sure
that all users of the program also receive the freedoms you hold. For
example, if you release a program for general public use, you must
distribute the source code in a form that users can readily obtain.
If you do not, you are violating the freedoms that this License is
intended to protect.

  Finally, you need to understand that there is no warranty for this
free software. It is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind.

                            TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy. The resulting "modified version" of the work must also be
licensed under "this License."

  A "covered work" means either the Program or a modified version of it.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that displays: (1) copyright notice(s), (2) a notice that the
work is published under this License, (3) a notice that there is no
warranty, and (4) the ability to view the text of this License. If the
interface presents a list of user commands or options, the list or menu
should include an item that displays this information.

1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source form of a
work.

  A "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and run the object code and
to modify the work. This includes all scripts, interface definition
files, header files, and anything else needed to compile and install the
object code.

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can
regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

  The Corresponding Source is part of the work covered by this License;
you may convey a covered work in object code form only if accompanied
by the Corresponding Source.

2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, constituting
a work in itself, is covered by this License.

3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under Article 11
of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar
laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of technological measures.

  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to prohibit
or restrict circumvention of technological measures to the extent that
such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License
with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to seek
to enforce any prohibition or restriction on the exercise of rights under
this License with respect to the covered work.

4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the absence
of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along
with the Program.

  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or a work combined with
the Program with modifications, provided that you also meet all of these
conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any smaller number of additional
    permissions to use the work.

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional permissions, to the whole work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have received it.

    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.

6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
Corresponding Source in one of the ways specified in section 1.

7. Additional Permissions.

  "Additional permissions" are permissions to use all or part of the
Program outside the terms of this License, or to use the Program with
terms other than those contained in this License. These may be granted
together with the Program for each particular instance, or separately.

  This License is not intended to limit any permission for copyright
infringement in the program by law.

  If you add terms and conditions to a covered work that are not
required by this License, then you may not convey them without also
complying with this License.

  For example, if you wish to distribute a program under different
terms, you must provide a way for the user to remove the terms they
are not permitted to use. If that is not possible, you should not
distribute the program.

  Nothing in this License limits any permission for copyright
infringement from an independent source that you may have been granted.

  If a covered work has "additional permissions" to which you grant
access under this License, then all those permissions must be included
in the copy you convey, and you must make sure that all the included
additional permissions can be revoked by the recipient.

8. Termination.

  You may not convey a covered work except as expressly provided under
this License. Any attempt otherwise to convey or to obtain a license to
the covered work is void, and will automatically terminate your rights
under this License.

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license to the Program becomes reinstated: (1) provisionally, unless
and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your
license, and (2) permanently, if the copyright holder does not notify
you of the violation by any reasonable means prior to one year after
the cessation of your violation.

  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you have received the Program, your
license to it will be terminated if you take any action to cause others
to be in violation of this License. This includes any action to cause
others to be in violation of this License for the benefit of yourself
or others.

9. Acceptance.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program. However, if you do so, you agree to this
License, and all its terms and conditions, for any such covered work.
You also agree to be bound by its terms for any derivative works you
create.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to use the Program.

10. Amendments.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or
of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the
Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public
License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

11. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

12. Limitation of Liability.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

13. Interpretation of Sections 11 and 12.

  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above
cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing
courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute
waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a
warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in
return for a fee.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software that everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full license text is.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program does not handle terminal input, a user interface might
still need to print these notices, for example, in a "About" box.

You can also get information about how to make sure your program is
free in terms of freedom, not price, by writing to the Free Software
Foundation.
